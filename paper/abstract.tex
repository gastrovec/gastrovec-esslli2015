In this work, we present a distributional semantic model for recipes by building a representation of food ingredients and recipes in terms of co-occurrence vectors, recording their distributional pattern in a recipe corpus. We build a space for ingredients and two spaces for recipes. We show that by composing ingredients in a recursive manner we get a more accurate approximation of recipes than by a more basic method. This idea can be exploited in order to generate new recipes using existing ingredients by looking at similar vectors. Alternatively, it can be used to build an app which might be used to get inspiring ideas for what to cook while having a list of ingredients.
