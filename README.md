#Gastrovec

Data related to [Oberl√§nder and Bostan (2015)](paper/gastronomics.pdf), published in the [Proceedings of the ESSLLI 2015 Student Session](http://esslli-stus-2015.phil.hhu.de/esslli-stus-2015-proceedings.pdf).

## paper, presentation, poster

These folders contain what we submitted to, held in and presented at ESSLLI 2015.

## corpus_collection

This repo doesn't ship with the raw data, due to its huge-ish size and questionable legality. You should be able to reproduce creating the space though. A requirement for all Python scripts is the [DISSECT](https://github.com/composes-toolkit/dissect) toolkit.

## vector_processing

This folder contains the scripts necessary to recreate the vector space. The SVD-20 version of the space is included, but not the bigger versions.

It also has all the scripts that are actually fun.

## vis and evaluation

This contains nothing very interesting.
